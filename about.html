            <p class="bio">after spending ten years in the desert, you start to see mirages; of things you used to love being surrounded by every day, of seasons, of people you moved away from ... you remember what it was like to drive by the ocean every day, feel the energy shift of the weather and be surrounded by history.</p>
            <p class="bio">i'm in love with music, learning new languages, photography, art collection, traveling, business, yoga, and i'm really good at only half-finishing books then picking them back up a year later.</p>
